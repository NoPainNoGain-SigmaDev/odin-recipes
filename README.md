# Odin Recipes 🍔🍰

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to my **odin-recipes** project, where I’m diving into the world of dynamic HTML with **PHP**. The goal? To stop repeating myself by using a bunch of different HTML files for each recipe. Instead, I’m using PHP to create one dynamic page that can handle multiple recipes with ease. 

## What’s this about? 🤔

This is a **recipes app** where I’ve set up a single page to display all my favorite recipes. It’s like your typical recipe website, but with a twist: I’m doing everything with PHP, so no more copying and pasting static HTML for every single recipe! 📃➡️⚡

## Tech Stack 🔥

- **PHP** for dynamic content (where all the magic happens)
- **HTML/CSS** for the basic structure and styling
- **A bit of JavaScript** just for some extra flare (maybe a tiny script to make things interactive)

## Features ⚙️

- Dynamic rendering of recipes 🚀
- Easy to add new recipes without messing with a ton of HTML files
- Simple styling to make the recipes look yummy 😋
