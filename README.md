# 🌴 Odin Recipes

A light-hearted (basic :)) web app showcasing some recipes with a humorous twist to help you stay “in shape” this summer. Built as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes#project-solution) curriculum (Foundations Course First project).

  sizes, let's just call it responsive)

- Manatee-themed 10/10 (timers and big guy)
- A pinch of satire
- The title takes you back to home

## 💡 Inspiration

This parody site was **inspired by funny recipe ideas from [Food.com](https://www.food.com/ideas/funny-food-recipes-6352#c-23291)**. Their humor helped me to bring this cozy site to life.
